        "Recently got my eyebrows ombr√©'d by Kat." 
        + " I went for the initial brow appointment and came back 2 months later for the touch up as well." 
        + " My brows were a bit challenging to work with because I had previously microbladed brows which turned red after a few years." 
        + " Kat covered up the redness and added a few strands in the inner corners to achieve the most natural look, exactly what I wanted." 
        + " I'm really happy with the results!",

        "Got my eyebrows done by Kat and she was amazing." 
        + " She was super sweet and I let her work her magic of mapping my brows and choosing the best shade and I loved her recommendations."
        + " She always checked in to see if I was pain."
        + " Will definitely come back for my yearly touch ups! 10/10 recommended",
