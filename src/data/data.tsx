        "Recently got my eyebrows ombr√©'d by Kat."

        + " My brows were a bit challenging to work with because I had previously microbladed brows which turned red after a few years." 
        + " Kat covered up the redness and added a few strands in the inner corners to achieve the most natural look, exactly what I wanted."
